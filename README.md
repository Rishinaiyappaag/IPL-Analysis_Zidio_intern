# IPL- Prediction_and_Analysis_Zidio_intern
🏏 IPL Analysis Dashboard & Python Explorations
This repository features an IPL (Indian Premier League) data analysis project implemented using two powerful tools:

Power BI for dynamic dashboards and interactive visualizations.

Python (with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) for modular, script-based data analysis and visual storytelling.

# 📁 Files Included
IPL ANALYSIS.pbit – Power BI Template with prebuilt dashboards.

1.py – Modular Python script performing various IPL analyses using visual libraries.

Match_&_Team_Performance_Analysis.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook for team-focused statistical analysis.

zidio1.ipynb – Additional Python-based visual analytics .

matches.csv, deliveries.csv – (Expected to be present in the working directory for Python scripts to function.)
